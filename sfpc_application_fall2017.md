<h2>Year of birth?</h2>
1989

<h2>Where are you from and where are you based now?</h2>
Born and based in Santiago de Chile.

<h2>Why do you want to study at SFPC at this point in your life? (200 words or less)</h2>
I am a musician and an electrical engineer, with a strong technical background but lacking on arts education. I am proficient with coding, both for my job as engineer and my practice as musician, and I want to focus and develop a stronger conceptual framework for my art. I am a user and promoter of creative coding, particularly after stumbling upon Processing, p5.js and Max, which I have incorporated to my performances and work.<br>
Due to my artistic interests I visited NYC last year and had the opportunity of meet NYU ITP, a place where creative and collaborative environment inspired me to explore and expand my artistic practice and knowledge. Being there I heard about SFPC too. Given the above, attending fall immersive is the best next step for my artistic career. It also inspired me to engage and build communities around media arts in Chile.<br>
Earlier this year I co-founded 'Coded - School of Electronic Arts and Crafts', exposing young and aspiring artists to open source media arts software. I am currently teaching introduction to programming and visual arts using p5.js for high school students. Due to this, I need to improve my skills on teaching creative coding.


<h2>What do you want the School for Poetic Computation to be? (200 words or less)</h2>
I want SFPC to be both a place of inspiration and a community of creative humans with similar artistic and geeky interests. I expect it to be a haven where I can develop my artistic side - more linked to music - by trying and experimenting on creative coding and creative approaches between technology and arts, and a place where I can work on my projects and get feedback and advice from the community.<br>
I also want SFPC to be a place where I can learn from my peers and teachers - particularly different ways of approaching and teaching media arts - and I can share my experience in coding and electronics, and my artist practice in general. Also, I want to share and receive critique about my ideas and conceptions on arts, expanding my horizons and my artistic, poetic and aesthetic theory.

<h2>What would you like to make at SFPC (500 words or less)</h2>
At SFPC I want to focus on the aesthetic concept behind my musical project "Sector Coordillera", a duo based on Santiago de Chile. Our work deals with the automation of artistic processes and the conversation between technology and performer, specially for live performance.

For this project I develop and design generative visuals that narrate stories based on the musical and lyrical content. At SFPC I want to both reformulate and fine tune my aesthetics, concepts and poetics of so that I can develop a creative-open source tool for my duo to perform with, in a performance art realm, instead of just a live music concert. I’d like to share my work and my process with my peers at SFPC, learn from their experience and background and nurture from their critique and feedback.<br>
Another interest I have is learning from the SFPC experience as an educational organization, particularly because of it being a self-managed organization with a non-profit mission. I want to become a better educator and promoter of creative coding practices in a Latin American context, and also a good administrator and organizer so that Coded School is sustainable in time. I’d like to learn about SFPC's mission, ethos, and strategies so I can use this experience and adapt it to work effectively in the Chilean context. Besides, my learning experience at SFPC will be a great contribution to my practice of being and educator of media arts. I am excited about learning teaching strategies that are alternatives to educational dichotomies such as horizontality vs. hierarchy, or community vs. competition. I’m also excited of sharing tips and resources with the whole community.<br>

Finally, I’d like to grasp and refine my notions on arts, poetics, aesthetics, coding and education. Because of my technical background as an engineer I have advanced skills in programming and electronics. In contrast, my arts education is mostly self-taught and limited, so I'm excited to be able to step it up.

Hi, my name is Guillermo Montecinos Peña and I'm appliying to SFPC's 2017 fall immersive.<br>
1.<br>
I want SFPC to be a place of inspiration for me. I’m a musician and an electrical engineer and my formal education so far has been technical, whilst my musical, artistic and aesthetic education are mostly self-taught. I expect SFPC to be a place where I can learn in an interdisciplinary environment topics such creativity, design, story-telling, arts, and poetics. I want to learn from my peers, from their points of view, from their backgrounds and artistic practice, and I want to share with them what I know.<br>

I also expect SFPC to be a haven where I can work with no worries and no prejudices and where we can give critique to each other in an insightful, honest and safe way. I want it to be somewhere I can develop my artistic conception by trying and experimenting on creative coding and creative approaches between technology and arts.<br>

I’m also very interested in learning new ways of teaching media arts because I’m currently working and teaching on an independent media arts school in Chile, called Coded - School of Electronic Arts and Crafts.<br>

2.<br>
I’d like to contribute by doing my best work so far at SFPC. While I am there, I want to promote and distribute the work I do by having good documentation and writing about my experience there. Most of the arts community I know back home in Chile don't know about SFPC and I want to be a good source of insider information about the opportunities of learning at SFPC and other creative and collaborative spaces in NYC.<br>

In the media arts school I am working on, we are building a strong community of people with interest in media arts, and we are going strong on Facebook and in our mailing list, and I want to incorporate some essays and blog posts on my experience at attending SFPC to, which will reach more than 500 people.<br>

Thank you very much for that opportunity.


<h2>Would you like to participate in the Onboarding Week for beginners?</h2>
No, because I have a strong coding background in the fundamentals and also I am experienced in languages such as C,  Processing, JavaScript, p5.js, HTML and Max.

<h2>Do you want to apply for the work-study position? If so, please explain how this helps you attend.</h2> 
No, because I want to focus on learning, studying and sharing with the media arts community of NYC as much I can.
