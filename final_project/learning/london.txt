The blushing dawn the easy illumes.
The birds their merry matins sing.
The buds breath forth their sweet perfumes.
And butterflies are on the wing.
I pause beneath the window high.
The door is locked, the house is quiet.
'Tis there, abed, she sure must lie.
To Wake her, - ah! I'll try it.
And pebbles hurtling through the air.
Strike full upon the window-pane.
Awakening her who slumbers there.
With their insistent hurricane.
Ye gods! in my imagination.
The wondrous scene do I behold.
A nymph's bewildered consternation.
At summons thus so fierce and bold.
A moment passes, then I see.
The gauzy curtains drawn aside.
And sweet eyes beaming down on me.
And then a window upward glide.
Fair as the morn, with rosy light.
She blushes with a faint surprise.
Then thinking of the previous night.
In dulcet tones she softly cries.
"It should have been put out by Nan.
But I'll be down within a minute.
No, never mind, leave your own can.
And put two quarts, please, in it.
