She lit a burner on the stove.
And offered me a pipe.
I thought you'd never say hello, she said.
You look like the silent type.
Then she opened up a book of poems.
And handed it to me.
Written by an Italian poet.
From the 13th Century.
And every one of them words rang true.
And glowed like burnin' coal.
Pourin' off of every page.
Like it was written in my soul from me to you.
Tangled up in blue.
